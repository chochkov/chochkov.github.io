career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I studied Applied Mathematics at Sofia University in Bulgaria;
      specialised in Data Analysis at the University of Electro-Communications in
      Tokyo and then moved to Berlin. There I joined a Statistics Master at Humboldt
      University, but didn't finish it to start working.

      I started with an internship
      in Machine Learning at SoundCloud, then worked on freelance projects in software
      development and data science before joining mobile analytics company Adjust,
      where I've taken engineering and data science roles for over 6 years.

      Following a short break after I've left Adjust, I started the website <a
      href='https://www.bi-outsourced.com' target='_blank'>www.bi-outsourced.com</a>,
      through which I'm offering Business Intelligence and Data Science consulting
      services.
