career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I studied Applied Mathematics at Sofia University in Bulgaria;
      specialised in Data Analysis at the University of Electro-Communications in
      Tokyo and then moved to Berlin. Here I joined a Statistics Master at Humboldt
      University, but I found startups more fun, so I dropped in favour of joining the scene.

      I started with an internship
      in Machine Learning at SoundCloud, then worked on freelance projects in software
      development and data science before joining mobile analytics company Adjust,
      where I took engineering and data science roles for over 6 years.

      Following a short break after I left Adjust, I ran my own Business
      Intelligence and Data Science consultancy for about 2 years, before I
      joined the fantastic team of Flowkey. There I combine my passion for
      music and piano with my technological professional background.
